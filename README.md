  The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States radically restructured the pedagogy within all levels of education. More specifically, most higher education institutions closed in the later half of March 2020 to help stop the spread of COVID-19; instructors nationwide shifted to remote learning as the medium of instruction. Although some institutions implemented a hybrid education model for the Fall 2020 semester, the majority of universities opted for an entirely remote semester to help combat the pandemic. Remote instruction seems to significantly increase the number of stressors that exist for college students, and therefore further exacerbate the mental health crisis.
  
  This paper will explore how the absence of in-person instruction and peer-to-peer contact as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic affects college student’s mental health. This topic is incredibly interesting to us in particular because, as college students at UC Berkeley, we have been dramatically impacted by the shift to online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we believe that research into this topic and the actual effects—if there are any—would prove not only interesting but also valuable as we look to begin another semester of remote education. We created a survey to measure the anticipated impacts, which ultimately seeks to measure the mental well-being of college students through various questions regarding mental health and online learning within the constraints of the pandemic.
